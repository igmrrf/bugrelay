# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BugRelay documentation build is failing due to 36 dead links detected by VitePress. This feature addresses the systematic identification and resolution of broken internal and external links in the documentation to ensure a successful build process and improved user experience.

## Glossary

- **VitePress**: The static site generator used for building the BugRelay documentation
- **Dead Link**: A hyperlink that points to a non-existent page, file, or resource
- **Documentation System**: The complete set of markdown files and configuration that generates the BugRelay docs
- **Link Validator**: VitePress's built-in system that checks for broken links during build
- **Internal Link**: A link pointing to another page within the same documentation site
- **External Link**: A link pointing to resources outside the documentation site

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the documentation build to succeed without dead link errors, so that I can deploy updated documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation build process runs, THE Documentation System SHALL complete successfully without dead link failures
2. WHEN VitePress validates links during build, THE Documentation System SHALL contain no broken internal links
3. WHEN external links are checked, THE Documentation System SHALL handle unavailable external resources gracefully
4. WHERE dead links are identified, THE Documentation System SHALL provide clear error reporting with specific file locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to identify and categorize all broken links, so that I can prioritize fixes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL provide a comprehensive audit of all dead links with their locations
2. THE Documentation System SHALL categorize links as internal, external, or anchor links
3. THE Documentation System SHALL identify missing files that are referenced by internal links
4. THE Documentation System SHALL validate that all navigation menu items point to existing pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading the documentation, I want all links to work correctly, so that I can navigate seamlessly through related content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any internal link, THE Documentation System SHALL navigate to the correct page
2. WHEN a user accesses referenced files or resources, THE Documentation System SHALL serve the content successfully
3. THE Documentation System SHALL maintain consistent URL patterns across all pages
4. WHERE placeholder content exists, THE Documentation System SHALL provide meaningful stub pages instead of dead links

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be configurable for dead link handling, so that I can control build behavior in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL allow configuration of dead link checking behavior
2. WHERE external links are temporarily unavailable, THE Documentation System SHALL continue building successfully
3. THE Documentation System SHALL distinguish between critical internal links and non-critical external links
4. WHEN in development mode, THE Documentation System SHALL provide warnings instead of build failures for external links
