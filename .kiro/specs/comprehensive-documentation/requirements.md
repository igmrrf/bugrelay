# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation of the BugRelay backend server. The documentation should provide complete API reference, authentication guides, data models, and usage examples that enable developers to integrate with and use the backend server without needing to examine the source code.

- **API_Client**: Any application or service that consumes the BugRelay backend API
- **Developer**: A software engineer who needs to integrate with or understand the BugRelay backend
- **Documentation_System**: The comprehensive documentation that describes all aspects of the backend server
- **Authentication_Flow**: The process of user registration, login, and token management
- **Bug_Management_System**: The core functionality for creating, viewing, and managing bug reports
- **Company_Verification_System**: The process for companies to claim and verify their applications
- **MCP_Documentation**: Model Context Protocol compatible documentation format for AI systems
- **OpenAPI_Specification**: Machine-readable API documentation following OpenAPI 3.0 standard
- **AI_System**: Artificial intelligence tools and agents that need to interact with the API
