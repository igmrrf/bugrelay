## Common Integration Patterns

### Authentication Patterns

All examples demonstrate secure authentication patterns:

1. **User Registration & Login**
   - Email/password authentication
   - OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
   - Token management and refresh
   - Profile management

2. **API Key Authentication**
   - For server-to-server communication
   - Logging and monitoring endpoints
   - Webhook verification

### Bug Management Workflows

Complete workflows for bug tracking:

1. **Bug Submission**
   - Anonymous submissions with reCAPTCHA
   - Authenticated user submissions
   - File attachments and screenshots
   - Metadata collection (OS, browser, version)

2. **Bug Interaction**
   - Voting and popularity tracking
   - Comment threads and discussions
   - Status updates and resolution tracking
   - Company responses and communication

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Full-text search across bug reports
   - Advanced filtering by status, priority, tags
   - Pagination and sorting options
   - Application and company-specific views

### Company Integration Workflows

For companies managing their bug reports:

1. **Company Verification**
   - Domain-based company claiming
   - Email verification process
   - Team member management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Bug Management**
   - Company dashboard and analytics
   - Status updates and resolution tracking
   - Customer communication
   - Internal team collaboration

## Error Handling Best Practices

All examples include comprehensive error handling:

- **HTTP Status Codes** - Proper handling of 4xx and 5xx responses
- **Rate Limiting** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Token Refresh** - Seamless authentication token renewal
- **Network Errors** - Graceful handling of connectivity issues
- **Validation Errors** - Clear error messages for invalid input

## Testing and Development

### Development Environment Setup

Examples for setting up local development:

```bash
# Start local BugRelay API server
docker-compose up -d

# Set environment variables
export BUGRELAY_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
export BUGRELAY_API_KEY="your_development_api_key"
```

### Testing Scripts

Each language section includes:
- Unit test examples
- Integration test patterns
- Mock server setup for testing
- CI/CD pipeline integration
